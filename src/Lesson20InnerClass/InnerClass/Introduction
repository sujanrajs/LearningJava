An inner class is declared inside the curly braces of another enclosing class.
Inner class is coded inside a Top level class as shown below:-

//Top level class definition

class MyOuterClassDemo {
   private int myVar= 1;

   // inner class definition
   class MyInnerClassDemo {
      public void seeOuter () {
         System.out.println("Value of myVar is :" + myVar);
      }
    } // close inner class definition
} // close Top level class definition


Inner class acts as a member of the enclosing class and can have any access modifiers:
abstract, final, public, protected, private, static.
Inner class can access all members of the outer class including those marked private as
shown in the above example where inner class is accessing the private variable "myVar" of outer class.
