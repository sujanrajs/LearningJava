Advantage of method overriding

The main advantage of method overriding is that the class can give its own specific implementation
to a inherited method without even modifying the parent class code.

This is helpful when a class has several child classes,
so if a child class needs to use the parent class method,
it can use it and the other classes that want to have different implementation can use overriding
feature to make changes without touching the parent class code.
