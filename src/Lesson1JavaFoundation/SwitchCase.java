    Explanation: In switch I gave an expression, you can give variable also.
    I gave num+2, where num value is 2 and after addition the expression resulted 4.
    Since there is no case defined with value 4 the default case got executed.
    This is why we should use default in switch case,
    so that if there is no catch that matches the condition, the default block gets executed.

    Now you can see that only case 2 had been executed, rest of the cases were ignored.
    Why did not I use break statement after default?
    The control would itself come out of the switch after default so I did not use it,
    however if you still want to use the break after default then you can use it,
    there is no harm in doing that.

    /*
    The expression given inside switch should result in a constant value otherwise
    it would not be valid.
    For example:

    Valid expressions for switch:
    switch(1+2+23)
    switch(1*2+3%4)

    Invalid switch expressions:
    switch(ab+cd)
    switch(a+b+c)
    Nesting of switch statements are allowed, which means you can have switch statements
    inside another switch. However nested switch statements should be avoided
    as it makes program more complex and less readable.
