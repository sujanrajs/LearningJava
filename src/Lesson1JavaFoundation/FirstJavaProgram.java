/*
public class FirstJavaProgram {
This is the first line of our java program. Every java application must have at least one class
definition that consists of class keyword followed by class name.
When I say keyword, it means that it should not be changed,
we should use it as it is. However the class name can be anything.

I have made the class public by using public access modifier,
I will cover access modifier in a separate post,
all you need to know now that a java file can have
any number of classes but it can have only one public class and
the file name should be same as public class name.

public static void main(String[] args)  {
This is our next line in the program, lets break it down to understand it:
public: This makes the main method public that means that we can call the method from outside the class.

static:
We do not need to create object for static methods to run. They can run itself.

void:
It does not return anything.

main:
It is the method name. This is the entry point method from which the JVM can run your program.

(String[] args):
Used for command line arguments that are passed as strings.
We will cover that in a separate post.

System.out.println("This is my first program in java");
This method prints the contents inside the double quotes into the console and inserts a newline after.
