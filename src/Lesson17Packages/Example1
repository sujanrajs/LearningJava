a class Calculator inside a package name letmecalculate.
To create a class inside a package, declare the package name in the first statement in your program.
A class can have only one package declaration.
Calculator.java file created inside a package letmecalculate

package letmecalculate;

public class Calculator {
   public int add(int a, int b){
	return a+b;
   }
   public static void main(String args[]){
	Calculator obj = new Calculator();
	System.out.println(obj.add(10, 20));
   }
}


Now lets see how to use this package in another program.

import letmecalculate.Calculator;
public class Demo{
   public static void main(String args[]){
	Calculator obj = new Calculator();
	System.out.println(obj.add(100, 200));
   }
}

To use the class Calculator, I have imported the package letmecalculate.
In the above program I have imported the package as letmecalculate.Calculator,
this only imports the Calculator class.
However if you have several classes inside package letmecalculate then you can import the package like this,
to use all the classes of this package.

import letmecalculate.*;
