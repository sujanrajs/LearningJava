A package inside another package is known as sub package.
For example If I create a package inside letmecalculate package then that will be called sub package.

Lets say I have created another package inside letmecalculate
and the sub package name is multiply.
So if I create a class in this subpackage it should have this package declaration in the beginning:

package letmecalculate.multiply;

Multiplication.java

package letmecalculate.multiply;
public class Multiplication {
	int product(int a, int b){
		return a*b;
	}
}

Now if I need to use this Multiplication class I have to either import the package like this:

import letmecalculate.multiply;

or I can use fully qualified name like this:

letmecalculate.multiply.Multiplication obj =
     new letmecalculate.multiply.Multiplication();
