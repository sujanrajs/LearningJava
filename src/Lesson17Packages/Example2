Example 2: Creating a class inside package while importing another package

As we have seen that both package declaration and package import should be the first statement in your java program.
Lets see what should be the order when we are creating a class inside a package while importing another package.

//Declaring a package
package anotherpackage;
//importing a package
import letmecalculate.Calculator;
public class Example{
   public static void main(String args[]){
	Calculator obj = new Calculator();
	System.out.println(obj.add(100, 200));
   }
}
So the order in this case should be:
→ package declaration
→ package import
