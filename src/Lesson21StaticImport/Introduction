Static import allows you to access the static member of a class directly without using the
fully qualified name.

To understand this topic, you should have the knowledge of packages in Java.
Static imports are used for saving your time by making you type less.
If you hate to type same thing again and again then you may find such imports interesting.

Points to note:
1) Package import syntax:

import static java.lang.System.out;
import static java.lang.Math.*;
2) Note comments given in the above code.


When to use static imports?
If you are going to use static variables and methods a lot then itâ€™s fine to use static imports.
for example if you wanna write a code with lot of mathematical calculations then
you may want to use static import.

Drawbacks
It makes the code confusing and less readable so if you are going to use static members very
few times in your code then probably you should avoid using it.
You can also use wildcard(*) imports.
