Method Overloading and Type Promotion
When a data type of smaller size is promoted to the data type of bigger size than
this is called type promotion, for example: byte data type can be promoted to short,
a short data type can be promoted to int, long, double etc.

What it has to do with method overloading?
Well, it is very important to understand type promotion else you will think that
the program will throw compilation error but in fact that program will run fine because of type promotion.
