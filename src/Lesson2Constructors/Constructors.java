/*
Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object.
A constructor resembles an instance method in java but itâ€™s not a method as it does not have a return type.
In short constructor and method are different(More on this at the end of this guide).
People often refer constructor as special type of method in Java.

Constructor has same name as the class and looks like this in a java code.

public class MyClass{
   //This is the constructor
   MyClass(){
   }
   ..
}

How does a constructor work
To understand the working of constructor, lets take an example. lets say we have a class MyClass.
When we create the object of MyClass like this:

MyClass obj = new MyClass()
The new keyword here creates the object of class MyClass and invokes the constructor
to initialize this newly created object.

public class Constructors {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
