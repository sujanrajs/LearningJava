A method without body (no implementation) is known as abstract method.
A method must always be declared in an abstract class, or in other words you can say that
if a class has an abstract method, it should be declared abstract as well.

public abstract int myMethod(int n1, int n2);
As you see this has no body.

Rules of Abstract Method:
1. Abstract methods don’t have body, they just have method signature as shown above.
2. If a class has an abstract method it should be declared abstract, the vice versa is not true,
which means an abstract class doesn’t need to have an abstract method compulsory.
3. If a regular class extends an abstract class, then the class must have to implement all
the abstract methods of abstract parent class or it has to be declared abstract as well.
