It is also known as Dynamic Method Dispatch.
Dynamic polymorphism is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime,
that's why it is called runtime polymorphism.

MethodOverRiding:
Declaring a method in sub class which is already present in parent class is known as method overriding.
Overriding is done so that a child class can give its own implementation to a method which
is already provided by the parent class. In this case the method in parent class is called overridden method
and the method in child class is called overriding method.
