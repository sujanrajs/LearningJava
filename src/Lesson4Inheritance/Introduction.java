/*

The process by which one class acquires the properties(data members)
and functionalities(methods) of another class is called inheritance.
The aim of inheritance is to provide the re-usability of code so that
a class has to write only the unique features and rest of the
common properties and functionalities can be extended from the another class.

Child Class:
The class that extends the features of another class is known as child class, sub class or derived class.

Parent Class:
The class whose properties and functionalities are used(inherited)
by another class is known as parent class, super class or Base class.

Note: The biggest advantage of Inheritance is that the code
that is already present in base class need not be rewritten in the child class.

This means that the data members(instance variables) and
methods of the parent class can be used in the child class as.

To inherit a class we use extends keyword.
Here class XYZ is child class and class ABC is parent class.
The class XYZ is inheriting the properties and methods of ABC class.

class XYZ extends ABC
