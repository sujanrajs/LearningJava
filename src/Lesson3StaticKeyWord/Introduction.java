/*

Static keyword can be used with class, variable, method and block. Static members belong to the
class instead of a specific instance, this means if you make a member static,
you can access it without object. Letâ€™s take an example to understand this:

Here we have a static method myMethod(), we can call this method without any object because
when we make a member static it becomes class level.
If we remove the static keyword and make it non-static then we must need to create
an object of the class in order to call it.

Static members are common for all the instances(objects) of the class but
non-static members are separate for each instance of class.
