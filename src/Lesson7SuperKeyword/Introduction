Although all three are related terms, there are some major differences in the way
they relate two classes. Association is a relationship between two separate classes and
the association can be of any type say one to one, one to may etc. It joins two entirely separate entities.

Aggregation is a special form of association which is a unidirectional one way relationship
between classes (or entities), for e.g. Wallet and Money classes.
Wallet has Money but money doesnâ€™t need to have Wallet necessarily so its a one directional relationship.
In this relationship both the entries can survive if other one ends.
In our example if Wallet class is not present, it does not mean that the Money class cannot exist.

Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities (or you can say classes)
are highly dependent on each other. For e.g. Human and Heart.
A human needs heart to live and a heart needs a Human body to survive.
In other words when the classes (entities) are dependent on each other and their life span are same
(if one dies then another one too) then its a composition.
Heart class has no sense if Human class is not present.
