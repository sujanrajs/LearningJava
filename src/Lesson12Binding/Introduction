Association of method call to the method body is known as binding.

There are two types of binding:
Static Binding that happens at compile time and Dynamic Binding that happens at runtime.

Static Binding vs Dynamic Binding:

1. Static binding happens at compile-time while dynamic binding happens at runtime.

2. Binding of private, static and final methods always happen at compile time since
these methods cannot be overridden. When the method overriding is actually happening and
the reference of parent type is assigned to the object of child class type then
such binding is resolved during runtime.

3. The binding of overloaded methods is static and the binding of overridden methods is dynamic.
