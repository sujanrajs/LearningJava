/*
Aggregation is a special form of association.
It is a relationship between two classes like association, however its a directional association,
which means it is strictly a one way association. It represents a HAS-A relationship.
Aggregation Example in Java
For example consider two classes StudentClass class and Address class.
Every student has an address so the relationship between student and address is a Has-A relationship.
But if you consider its vice versa then it would not make any sense as an Address doesnâ€™t
need to have a StudentClass necessarily.
Lets write this example in a java program. StudentClass Has-A Address
